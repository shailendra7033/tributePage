  Dr. Borlaug played crucial role in wheat production 
  in large quantity. He is popularly known as father of green 
  revolution. 
  The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a
   joint venture by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican 
   Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in genetics, 
   plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy,
    soil science, and cereal technology.<br> <br>The goal of the
     project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which 
  at the time was importing a large portion of its grain.
  During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project,
   he bred a series of remarkably 
  successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat.
